      <p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his pioneering work on alternating current (AC) electrical systems. His work revolutionized the transmission and use of electricity, setting the foundation for much of modern electrical engineering.</p>
      <p>Tesla's prolific career led to numerous innovations and over 300 patents. Some of his most notable inventions include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alternating Current (AC) System:</strong> Tesla's work on AC power laid the groundwork for the widespread adoption of electricity, allowing for the transmission of electrical power over long distances.</li>
        <li><strong>Tesla Coil:</strong> This high-voltage, high-frequency transformer is still used in radio technology, wireless communication, and entertainment today.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Transmission of Energy:</strong> Tesla envisioned a world where energy could be transmitted wirelessly, experimenting with large-scale projects such as the Wardenclyffe Tower.</li>
        <li><strong>Induction Motor:</strong> His invention of the rotating magnetic field and the development of the induction motor further propelled the use of AC power in industrial applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote Control:</strong> Tesla developed one of the first models of remote control, showcasing a radio-controlled boat in 1898.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Despite facing fierce competition, financial difficulties, and being overshadowed by contemporaries such as Thomas Edison, Teslaâ€™s legacy endures as one of the most brilliant minds in history. His vision for the future has inspired countless scientists, inventors, and engineers.</p>
